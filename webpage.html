<p>Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Daylight and everything. Soon enough. I'm Santa Claus! There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!</p>
<p>Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9. <strong>95 a minute.</strong> <em> You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!</em> Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!</p>

<p>But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. Then we'll go with that data file!</p>

<p>Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. I'll get my kit! I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!</p>
<p>There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor.</p>
<p>Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Soothe us with sweet lies. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…</p>
<p>Also Zoidberg. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Noooooo! Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</p>
<p>Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Throw her in the brig. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</p>
<p>Yeah, lots of people did. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."</p>
<p>Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. I never loved you. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Guess again.</p>
<p>But existing is basically all I do! Yeah, lots of people did. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.</p>
<p>Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. And I'm his friend Jesus. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?</p>
<p>If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! You are the last hope of the universe. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.</p>
<p>And why did 'I' have to take a cab? With gusto. No. We're on the top. Negative, bossy meat creature!</p>
